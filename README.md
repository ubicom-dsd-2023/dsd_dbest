## document about DB's docker image (version 1.0)

### environments

we run the commands on the Linux terminal.

packages should be installed:

- postgresql
- docker

### download the image

- run this command directly

```shell
docker pull sstillzh/pgsql
```

then we will get the image.

use

``` shell
docker images
```

to examine the download image

### run the container

- use "docker run" command to run the container

```shell
docker run -it --name postgres4 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD='123456' -e ALLOW_IP_RANGE=0.0.0.0/0  -p 55333:5432 -d sstillzh/pgsql
```

- -it: interact with the terminal

- -name: the name of the container

- -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD='123456': set the database-user's password

- -p: the port mapping of host system and docker system.(When we want to remotely connect the database，we use the "55333"port of the host )



- use 

``` shell
docker ps
```

to examine the running container

### enter the container and examine the database

#### enter the container

- use

```shell
docker exec -it postgres4 bash
```

​				to enter the container "postgres4"

#### examine the database



- change the role from root to postgres (because only the "postgres" has the privilege to access the database)

- our database

  - We now have two databases:
    1. production  :  save the data from server
    2. test : tester use the data to test
  - we haven't design the E-R model of data, so now there is only two relation tables in each database: 
    1. SENSOR: data from sensor
    2. USER : user's information
  - We will  improve our databases in the future

- common commands of psql

  

  - ```shel
    \l
    ```

    list all existing databases

  - ```shell
    \c dbname
    ```

    go into a database
