# Week 2

## What has been done:

### Bill (Database Architect):

#### Done
- Learned how to devise a database project:
  - Introduction to data normalization
  - R-E model

#### Not done, why?
- Spoke with Server Team to find what kind of data needs to be stored (delayed - taking too much time figuring out what questions to ask)


### Brioche (Database Engineer):

#### Done
- Reviewed the SQL course taken last semester
- Learned to do basic operations with PostgreSQL
- Started to learn docker
- Discussed with embedded system group about  
  - got known that data traffic should be 5 frames per second with 6 sensors
  - frame contains 9 numbers
  - Still don't know that the size required.

#### Not done, why?
- been sick with COVID
- not clear on the distinction between architecture and infrastructure

### Carlos (Architecture Tester):

#### Done
- learned some basic PostgreSQL
- started to learn SQLBolt
- started to learn docker
- started to learn how to do proper tests in SQL database

#### Not done, why?
- didn't finish docker because I dont have time.


### Maxwell (Infrastructure Tester):

#### Done
- Reviewed the SQL course taken last semester
- Learned to do basic operations with PostgreSQL
- Started to learn docker

#### Not done, why?
- Haven't finished learning Docker
- Haven't devised a strategy to test database infrastructure

Reason: 
  - been sick with COVID
  - not clear on the distinction between architecture and infrastructure

### Still (Database Developers):

#### Done
This week I have:
- learned about PostgreSQL
- installed PostgreSQL on my VM Ware(Linux)
- I use beekeeper to control my database conveniently. 
- I create our project's database(Production & Testing). 
- I learn how to use Git.

#### Not done, why?
- I haven't learn well about docker. 
  - Because I think it needs some time to practice it.
- I will do this at the beginning of next week.

### Watson  (Database Developers):

#### Done
- This week I have learned about PostgreSQL
- installed PostgreSQL on a server which is rented by myself. 
- And I use pgAdmin4 to manage it.
- I create our project's database.(maybe. But there it's no data in it. We don't have the R-E and data type)

#### Not done, why?
I don't know if I finish the task which is creating our project's database. Because I just creat database,but there is no Datasheet in it.


## Next goals:

- One thing we all need to start doing is sharing what we are doing in order to get timely feedback.
- Another thing I ask of you is: 
  - to give my opinion about my work method as a team leader.
  - propose changes in the work method in order to make it more to your liking and make our work easier. 
- Every time you complete a job, come to github (in this case, week 3) and update the status of your job,
 don't leave it for the last day. That way, we all know where the team's work stands.

This week I need you to talk among yourselves because your mission depends on it.

### Bill (Database Architect):

- [ ] This week I want the E-R model to be discussed and if possible by Wednesday we will have an almost final version. 
- [ ] I want to discuss the requirements that the database needs to guarantee. If possible, I want Wednesday to have a near-final version of them.

To accomplish the missions you must ask Brioche, Carlos and Maxwel for support. 
Carlos and Maxwel will validate the documentation you produce, as they will be 
the ones testing the database. Ask the other teams for feedback.

### Brioche (Database Engineer):

- [ ] You will be expected to help Bill with the tasks listed above. 
- [ ] I need you to support the creation of the database server in Docker. More details read the programmers' job description. 

This week I need you to take on the role of team moderator, you will be helping Bill with the architecture tasks while supporting the developers with docker. 


### Still and Watson (Database Developers):

- [ ] During this week, create a database that will be used for testing. If possible, this database should have the same architecture as the production database. During this week, create a database that will be used for testing. If possible, this database should have the same architecture as the production database. 

One of the assessments that the teacher will do is, go to our project on github and try to replicate our database on your PC using the documentation we have produced. 

- [ ] I want you to create a "step by step" documentation that is as easy to follow as possible. 
- [ ] Whenever you build or update the database you should publish a new version on github. See what "releases" and "packages" are on github.

For this task I need you to interact with Testers. You should publish documentation and a version of the database and the testers should be able to run the database on their own computer just using your documentation. 

### Carlos (Architecture Tester) and Maxwell (Infrastructure Tester):

- [ ] Read all the tasks (Bill, Brioche, Still, and Watson) mentioned above for this week.
- [ ] They should evaluate and give feedback as quickly and accurately as possible. 

Your feedback is important for the completion of the tasks.
In the case of the programmers' task, you should follow the instructions to the letter, if you have any doubts, you should point them out and report back so that they can improve.

- [ ] By analyzing the database architecture they should look for errors or if there is something missing. They should report it as soon as possible.
- [ ] They should start planning how they are going to test the database. All requirements have to be validated. 


If you have any questions or if you find any flaws, please report them. 

Thank you for your work and have a good week. ðŸš€
