- Now I can't commit my DB container to the dockerhub.

  > my method is :
  >
  > 1.  use  "docker commit" to commit the container to the image
  > 2. login the dockerhub
  > 3. push the image

  It can push to the dockerhub successfully. But I find it's an empty image. The databases I created  have lost.

- I can't  understand why the database lost when I commit the container to a image

- I searched on the net but it only has the solution to MySQL about this problem.

- I spend a lot of time trying to address this problem. But I failed. (crying)
