# Week 5

## What has been done:

### Bill (Database Architect):

#### Done
- finished drafting E-R model graphically(not final version) with help from Brioche
- designed a fluxogram for the possible use cases in the project (for future reference)

#### Not done, why?
- established a final E-R model due to changes still being made in the RA
- talked to the server team leader to discuss about the microservice to be implemented


### Brioche (Database Engineer):

#### Done
- established a reasonable version of ER model
- supported Still and Waston to improve the current database, tell them the structure of the form
- communicated with Bill and other teams to preliminarily determine the method of providing services to Server group -- writing python functions for Service group (such as SQL query) 

#### Not done, why?
- didn't determine the ER model, it's because Web team still has some requirements that aren't determined
- cannot give a credible interface design scheme, because the integrating version of RA hasn't determined

### Carlos (Architecture Tester):

#### Done
I Tried to fully understand why I have troubles following the step-by step tutorial

#### Not done, why?
Tested the Bill's E-R diagram and model.


### Maxwell (Infrastructure Tester):

#### Done
- Helped Brioche and the developers with spelling errors in the System Design documents.
- Successfully pulled the new docker image created by the developers.
- Continue learning about the testing strategies.

#### Not done, why?

### Still (Database Developers):

#### Done
- This week I update our docker image.  Based on the requirement-analysis and system-design, we now have a database structure. I have improved the database.
- We update the document . Now following the document, we could download the new docker image and check the structure of our database.
- I review the SQL query these days.
- I learn about how to use python to manage database.

#### Not done, why?
- We haven't accomplish the ''create all database requests " because now the interface hasn't been totally defined. We are creating some basic requests. We will finish this task as soon as possible. 

### Watson  (Database Developers):

#### Done
- We update our docker image and we creat the actual data table. 
- We update the readme document.
- I learn about how to use python to manage database and CRUD.

#### Not done, why?
- We need more detail about interface in order to finish our SDS.

## Next goals:

### Bill (Database Architect):

- [ ] Improve the E-R model and the database requirements. You should try to talk to the other teams in order to correct and improve the model.
- [ ] You should discuss with Brioche the structure and functionality of the DAO (database library)to be created by our team.

* Ask for feedback from the other teams.

### Brioche (Database Engineer):

- [ ] You should help Bill improve the E-R model and the database requirements.
- [ ] You should also discuss with Bill the structure and functionality of the DAO (database library)to be created by our team.

* Ask for feedback from the other teams.

### Carlos (Architecture Tester) and Maxwell (Infrastructure Tester):

- [ ] This week you should continue to support Bill and Brioche's tasks, be proactive and ask them what they need. You should also validate the documentation they produce.
- [ ] You should evaluate and provide feedback on the documentation and databases as quickly and accurately as possible. 
- [ ] When analyzing the database architecture, you should look for errors or if anything is missing. They should report it as soon as possible.
- [ ] It is critical that they analyze how they are going to test the database. All requirements must be validated.


### Still and Watson (Database Developers):

- [ ] During this week, you should continue to improve the database with new needs that arise. You should create one database for production and another for testing. 
- [ ] Should continue to improve the documentation so that it becomes easier to follow.
- [ ] Should start creating the python library with the methods that meet the functional requirements of the database.

For this task, I need you to interact with Testers. You should publish all the generated code on github inside a folder named "src".


Thank you for your work and have a good week. ðŸš€
