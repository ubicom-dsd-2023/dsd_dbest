- communicated with Bill and other teams to preliminarily determine the method of providing services to Server group -- writing python functions for Service group (such as SQL query) 

#### Not done, why?
- didn't determine the ER model, it's because Web team still has some requirements that aren't determined
- cannot give a credible interface design scheme, because the integrating version of RA hasn't determined

- This week I update our docker image.  Based on the requirement-analysis and system-design, we now have a database structure. I have improved the database.
- We update the document . Now following the document, we could download the new docker image and check the structure of our database.
- I review the SQL query these days.
- I learn about how to use python to manage database.

#### Not done, why?
- We haven't accomplish the ''create all database requests " because now the interface hasn't been totally defined. We are creating some basic requests. We will finish this task as soon as possible.
